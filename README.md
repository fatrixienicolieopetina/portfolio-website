<h2>WIL/Thoughts ðŸ¤”</h2>
<p>
  One thing that I liked about React is you have to think elements and components. Each part of the page can be treated as its own "entity" so reusability is very easy to  achieve. It is very different concept coming from an OOP language like Java, that it is almost always the case that developers should separate logic from the view. I believe that is not what React believes in. Rather, each component has its own UI and with that there is also the logic associated with that. In this exercise, I tried with React basics, reading about elements and components and also its basic routing for the simple navigation.

  I havent tried adding additional css, except from the code generated when you start creating a React application. That is why the look of the portfolio is very bland ðŸ˜† .
